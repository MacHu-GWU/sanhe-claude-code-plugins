# detect-python-version

Runs a script that outputs the Python version in `major.minor` format (e.g., `3.11`, `3.13`).

## Instructions

Execute the detection script with one of these commands (try in sequence):

1. `.venv/bin/python scripts/detect_version.py`
2. `python scripts/detect_version.py`

The script outputs just the version string, nothing else.

## Examples

**Output:** `3.11`

**Output:** `3.13`
